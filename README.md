# DATA ANALYSIS TOOL ANALYTICS Assignment_4

We used a dataset showing the top 4000 YouTube channels based on subscribers. We used the “iloc” command, which is integer index based to create a function to calculate the distribution of channeltype from the top 1000 records. 
Subsequently, we showed that distribution in a bar graph as can be seen in the code output.
Finally, we loaded only the top 1000 records of the original 4000 into a separate CSV file.  
The Pandas website article on iloc functions was particularly of help in solving these questions.
